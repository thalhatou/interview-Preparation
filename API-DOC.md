## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the CRUD API using Node.js and MongoDB. This API allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) resources from a MongoDB database using HTTP requests.

### Prerequisites

To use this API, you will need the following:

Node.js and npm (to install the necessary packages and run the API)
MongoDB (to store the resources)
Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine
Navigate to the directory in your terminal and run npm install to install the necessary packages
Set up a MongoDB database and update the .env file with the correct connection string
Run npm start to start the API
Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for interacting with the API:

GET /resources: Retrieve a list of all resources
GET /resources/:id: Retrieve a specific resource by its id
POST /resources: Create a new resource
PUT /resources/:id: Update an existing resource
DELETE /resources/:id: Delete an existing resource
